# Drum-Kit
A fun, interactive Javascript project using animations, event listeners, and audio files.

#Project Contributions
The HTML and CSS was done by instructor. The functionality of the page, (index.js) was done soley by me. I thoroughly enjoyed working out the problems as to how to add audio and animations whenever a certain key was pressed.
